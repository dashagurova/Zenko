Supported Protocols
===================

In addition to its support of various cloud backends, Zenko provides support for the 
following protocols for managing data:

   * Network File System (NFS)
   * Server Message Block/Common Internet File System (SMB/CIFS)

NFS is fully supported. SMB support requires manual configuration as described in
the "Adding CIFS Storage" section of the *Installation Guide*.
